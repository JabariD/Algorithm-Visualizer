## Background
This project started from the problem I had studying Data Structures and Algorithms. I created notes, went through tutorial websites, watched YouTube videos, but I wanted something that would make the content stick a little more. 

Algorithms have always been a topic that I was interested in, but I could never understand complex ones like I wanted to. I also have a love for building web applications. So I thought... "Hm, can I combine my two interests?".

## Overview
Using `create-react-app` will be the initial start of the web application. Other technologies that I will use include:

- Typescript to get rid of those pesky type errors.
- Material UI for styling.
- React Router for routing.
- Redux for state management.

## Requirements
The user will be able to create custom input.
The user will be able to change the speed of the algorithm.
The user will be able to see pseudocode of the algorithm.
The user will be able to see a description of the algorithm which includes it's time/space complexity, real-word applications and use cases, and coding interview problems in which it is used.

## Design
The design of the project is to make it as easy as possible for additional algorithms and data structures to be created.

## Future Developments
Adding more algorithms.
